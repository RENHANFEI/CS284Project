<h2 align="middle">Summary</h2>
<p>This is a 3D fireworks simulation system, based on particle systems. The project will simulate the explosive particles of the fireworks, the particles of dust, and the lighting effects between particles. The system will provide a user interface which allows customization of the fireworks so the user can create their own fireworks show experience.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part 1: Problem Description</h2>
<p>Fireworks are a class of low explosive pyrotechnic devices used for aesthetic and entertainment purposes. People enjoy fireworks for celebrations throughout the world. However, fireworks can pose risks of injury to people and damage of property, largely as a fire hazard, meanwhile producing smoke that causes air pollution.</p>
  
<p>We can instead create firework simulation for entertainment, celebration, and movie purposes and bring about the fantastic scenes. Currently there are few available options for firework simulation systems on the market. A popular such application is <a href="http://www.fwsim.com/">FWsim</a>, which can generate colorful fireworks and provides options for user custimization. However, the generated fireworks are not really true-to-life due to a few points. We observed the fireworks generated by FWsim, and found three main drawbacks in its simulation: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Colors are too saturated: the intensity of the color of the fire particles are not very similar to realistic representations of fireworks.</li>
  <li>Particles are too dense: the number and positioning of individual particles sometimes creates large blocks of particles that appear unnatural.</li>
  <li>Lack of dust or smoke particles: we should be able to observe clouds of dust as as in fireworks.</li>
</ol>

<p>We aim to create a simulator which includes dust particles and more realistic coloring.</p>
  
<p>The most challenging aspect of the application will revolve around the design of the particle object and the implementation of its movement as well as its lifecycle from detonation to death.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part 2: Goals and Deliverables</h2>

<h3>2.1 Fireworks Simulation</h3>
<p>We want to build a true-to-life firework simulation system based on particle systems, simulating not only the particles of the sparkles, but also the particles of dust and calculating the lighting among them. We decided to set the system in 3D for possible applications in VR and holographic projection. The finished application will include a GUI with simulation of multiple simultaneous fireworks at a time.</p>

<h3>2.2 Interactive System</h3>
<p>The GUI will include an user-friendly interface to let users customize their fireworks show. Users will be able to generate realistic fireworks with a mouse click. The interface will include customization options for parameters such as size, location, color, and shape to be adjusted in order allow users to view different results.</p>

<h3>2.3 Performance</h3>
<p>The system should generate realistic fireworks and combustion products in real-time. It should also allow users to make changes and create their own fireworks shows in the GUI and display the changes in real-time.</p>

<h3>2.4 Baseline Plan </h3>
<ul>
<li>Implement the simulation system with OpenGL and nano-gui.</li>
<li>Define the firework particle objects, and model the motion of the fireworks using a particle system.</li>
<li>Model the mixture of dust and smoke filling the environment where the explosion occurs.</li>
<li>Update particles in the system during detonation, dispersal, and ignition.</li>
</ul>
  
<p>An important determinant of success will be how realistically we can model the motion of the firework particle objects. We will need to keep track of and take into account multiple physical related attributes of each particle such as mass, size, location, color, shape, and point in lifecycle, as well as movement related attributes such as direction, velocity, and acceleration. The system will need to model these attributes and use them to correctly update the lifecycle of the particle in the system in real time.</p>

<h3>2.5 Aspirational Plan</h3>
<ul>
<li>Interactions between firework particles and surrounding environment (e.g. lighting effects on buildings from the fireworks).</li>
<li>Implement methods to speed up calculations for better real time performance.</li>
<li>Generate fireworks with irregular patterns.</li>
</ul>
